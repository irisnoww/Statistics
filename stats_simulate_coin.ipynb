        "A famous French mathematician Pierre Raymond De Montmart, who was known for his work in combinatorics, proposed a simple game called as Game of Thirteen. You have a deck of 13 cards, each numbered from 1 through 13. Shuffle this deck and draw cards one by one. A coincidence is when the number on the card matches the order in which the card is drawn. For instance, if the 5th card you draw happens to be a 5, it's a coincidence. You win the game if you get through all the cards without any coincidences. Let's calculate the probability of winning at this game using simulation.\n",
